# Tic_Tac
Uses a 3x3 char[][] board ('X', 'O', or ' ').  Two players take turns; the program validates input and rejects illegal moves.  After each move, it checks for:  a win (any row, column, or diagonal),  a draw (board full, no winner).  Cleanly separates logic into small methods: printBoard, isWin, isDraw, makeMove, switchPlayer, etc
